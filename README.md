#Automata.py
####Simple program to construct automata (theory of computation) and check if strings are accepted by it

 Usage: `./Automata.py -h` (for help) or
 `./Automata.py -i inputfile.txt -c checkfile.txt`
 Both -i and -c arguments are optional.
 Input file is a file with Automata.py prompt commands (one command per line)
 Check file is a file with strings to be checked by current automaton (one strig per line)
 for help while in program prompt run program and type 'help'

After executing Automata.py a prompt appears.
Prompt commands:
add node1 node2 ...
conn node_from node_to transitionchar1 transitionchar2 ...
start node (makes node starting node)
end node (makes node an ending node)
check string (checks if string is accepted)
reset (makes a new automaton)
file myfile.txt (loads a file with commands)
checkfile myfile.txt (loads a file with one string per line and checks them with current automaton)
dump myfile.txt (saves current state to file to be loaded with file command)
print (prints current state)
exit (exits program)
help (displays this information)


Example of input file:
```
add q0 q1 q2 q3
conn q0 q0 0
conn q0 q1 1 4 7
conn q0 q2 2 5 8
conn q0 q3 3 6 9
conn q1 q2 1 4 7
conn q1 q1 0 3 6 9
conn q1 q3 2 5 8
conn q2 q2 0 3 6 9
conn q2 q1 2 5 8
conn q2 q3 1 4 7
conn q3 q3 0 3 6 9
conn q3 q1 1 4 7
conn q3 q2 2 5 8
start q0
end q3
```
